            When hospitals were filled beyond capacity and bed ventilators were in short supply during the pandemic,
            many people got a glimpse of how devastating lung diseases can be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, lung function is not only harmed by respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, but also declines
            with age. Swelling or inflammation caused by disease, environmental exposures, or advanced age can also
            partially obstruct breathing passages and limit airflow, research shows. Now, a new study, shows how
            consuming nutrients called omega-3 fatty acids can reduce such inflammation and slow declining lung
            function. The report was published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine
        </p>
        <p>
            "It has already been proven that omega-3 fatty acids can help prevent cardiovascular disease, but the
            effects of omega-3s on other chronic conditions was unknown until this study," says Ana Zamora-Martinez, a
            pulmonologist at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, who was not involved in the study. She calls its findings
            "significant" because it's "the first study that shows the importance of omega-3 fatty acids in keeping the
            lungs healthy."
